                The glistening water swayed the boat as Roff stared into its depths.  His skin glowed a golden yellow from the lake swirled and danced around him.  He liked it out here, not many others liked to brave the waters, but he was different.  As he rode across its surface, he knew a sense of something (was it calming?) that he couldn’t find back in the village.  The sun shone a beautiful orange as it ascended the eastern sky.  It was another perfect morning, though those weren’t in short supply here.  He rowed passed remnants of the place this once was, though its name and purpose was lost to time.  
                As he traveled, his oar suddenly caught on something and jolted him to his right side.  He fell into the water, his chest leading the way.  He didn’t descend far though, as he abruptly and quickly smashed into something hidden under the waves.  Gathering his bearings, he placed his hands on the object.  It was very hard with a unique shine and a point at the end, yet he knew not what it was for it was just another relic of a bygone era lost to the lake, he supposed.  He pushed off it and resurfaced after a moment for he had not sunken far.  As he climbed back in the boat, he knew of a problem inside his chest.  The fall must’ve done some damage he proposed, though it was no matter.  He would head back immediately and have it looked at.
                A quarter day’s walk brought Roff back to the village, what he knew to call his home.  The dirt paths leading to and from the wooden houses that lined the passage were still slopped from a morning rain.  A quiet morning persisted on the street as the son commanded the sky, and brought a heat to dry the quaint assembly of life.  
            He traversed the paths until he found the doctor, his building most noticeable from the moss he let grow along the logs.  He entered through the doorway, and the doctor greeted him with a hello.  He sat down on the chair across from him and described what had happened at the lake.  “Could you lay on the table for me and I’ll assess the damage.”  After an extensive search of his chest, the doctor sat back down.  “I know the problem, but I’ve never seen anything like this before.”  Roff wondered what he meant, but asked for the details.  “Your heart, it’s damaged.  I found a crack along the surface and the integrity is no longer certain.”  Roff was confused, how could such a simple accident do such damage?  The doctor answered, “However miniscule the chances, the object you landed on must have hit you in just the right spot to bypass the protection of your chest.  I have known your next question and will answer it.  No, I can’t repair it.  The tools or knowledge to perform such a task simply do not exist.  I know sorrow for you.”  
            Roff leaned back in his spot, not knowing what this meant.  “Do you know of death?”  Roff shook his head, the word was foreign to him, but it seemed to have ominous overtones.  “This crack could cause your heart to simply fall apart at any moment without warning, or it may hold together forever as it should.  I don’t have the answer, but you need to know of the possibility you may die.  That is, stop existing.”  Roff could not put this thought straight in his head.  Stop…existing?  How could something that is, cease to be?  The doctor didn’t have the answers he needed, but advised him to be careful.  With that Roff left the building, and began the trek home.
                Roff arrived at this house about the time the sun had begun to lose its royal glow.  He entered his doorway sat in the chair in the corner of the space.  His head was still spinning from the day’s events, though he had never known such solidarity.  He had always had a problem communicating with those in his village, and now he was decidedly different.  As he sat there, he wondered what the others would now think of him, he knew he was no longer like them.  
                What is the point of thinking, of being?  He could stop existing at any moment, so why bother.  With that thought, Roff sat in that chair and made the choice to wait for death.  He waited, and waited, and continue to wait.  He sat in that chair for six days, waiting the moment to come when he would stop waiting.  Yet, his waiting continued.  Why must it wait he finally thought to himself.  Why can it not just happen now and be done, this knowing of not knowing is terrible.
            On the seventh day, his neighbor entered his doorway.  “Greetings Roff, you have been sitting here for almost a week now!  Would you like to talk about something?”  Roff knew appreciation for this act, but knew not the words to say.  Roff told his neighbor he liked sitting, all was well and they could return to their activities.  With a raise of his brow, he turned and left the house.  Maybe that was a good idea Roff thought, and after a moment left his home.
            He walked down the cracked dirt street out towards the forests, into the wild.  He did not know what he hoped to find here, but the sitting had not worked to find answers.  He decided to walk out to the lake again.  He thought along the way about his situation.  He still had no answer to what he should do now.  Does he continue to do his exploring as he always has, contributing to the village map?  What if his existence stopped on an expedition and he could never complete it?  He saw no point in continuing his task if there was no hope in finishing it.  He might as well just continue his sit, at least that would still be accomplished when he ceased.  Nevertheless, some part urged him forward, towards the lake.  
            He arrived at the lake, his boat still resting on the shores where he had left it.  He placed himself on the edge of his boat and stared out over the water.  He was about to enter another contemplative state when a voice cut through the air.  “This place has beauty I have never seen.”  My neighbor, Roff knew.  No one had ever accompanied him on an adventure, and he knew not that his neighbor was on this one with him.  “So, this is what your activity is like I suppose, seeing that which has been unseen.  What is that?”  Roff didn’t understand the question at first, but then knew what his neighbor had referred to.  He explained how when he had discovered and studied his activity, he learned of ways other than walking to travel.  Many he did not understand, but the boat made sense to him.  He had crafted it with tools he had obtained in the village, and wood he gathered from the trees around the lake.  “Can we ride in it?  I am not scared of the water.”  
            His neighbor walked over and sat inside the boat as Roff got up to push it in the water.  Roff grabbed his oar and jumped inside beginning his usual trek across the familiar waters.  His neighbor did as his neighbor does, talk and think.  Roff could not understand why his neighbor had chosen their activity to be such a thing, always talking to everyone.  Not only that, but constantly asking questions, and discussing what they knew.  It made no sense to Roff for he knew solidarity.  If he wanted information, he could just read about it.  Others may do as they please, but he has no gain from them.  “What is this place, what are these things, what are you thinking, how do you feel?”  That last question Roff also wondered, though not in the same way.  This was another word he did not know, and he was not sure where his neighbor had acquired it.
            “Could you show me where you fell?”  Roff complied and maneuvered the boat over to the place.  “Oh, I see it!  What is it?”  Roff did not know, obviously, or he would have told them what it was.  “So because of this, pointy thing, you are going to…die?  Which is to stop existing, which I didn’t even know was a thing.  Do you want to talk, that has to be eating you up inside.”  No, he didn’t.  Obviously talking wasn’t going to fix the crack, and there was nothing left to understand, he was doomed.  He had no potential in this world, nothing left to do.  
            “That has to feel horrible knowing that any moment could be your last.”  There’s that foreign word again.  He asked what it was then.  “Feel?  Well, it’s a feeling…er, its…hard to explain.  It’s like knowing, I suppose, but it’s less of a hard fact and more of a variable truth.  It just kind of happens.  Don’t worry, I haven’t met anyone that shared a knowledge of feeling.”  Roff wondered when it started, the ‘feeling’.  “It was not long after I pursued my activity.  I would ask the others questions, but then ask myself questions about their questions.  Before I knew it, there was this…connection to not only them, but myself. Something I had never experienced, and it opened up the world to me.”  Roff wondered if he would ever truly understand what they were even saying.
            Roff’s neighbor turned and looked at the object again, leaning over the boat for a closer view.  It all happened in an instant.  Without warning, a wave rocked the boat and sent the neighbor overboard.  In his mind, Roff saw his neighbor plunged into the same situation he was in, a limbo state of unknown end.  He knew of the struggle he was going through, but his neighbor did not understand.  He understood the inevitability of his demise, but they had no such concept.  They would instantly be in his world, this state of unknowing fog.  How sad, Roff thought.  Sad.  Sad?  He had known this word, but never understood it.  He knew of the word, but suddenly he understood it.  He knew sadness at this moment, but it was more than that.  At this moment, frozen in time with his neighbor’s future in the air, he understood the word.  There was a connection with his neighbor.
            He felt it.
                As quickly as the wave came, Roff’s hand caught his neighbor’s shoulder.  His neighbor stared into the water, and as Roff slowly brought them back into the boat they turned and looked at him.  “I…I could have…thank you.”  Roff looked at his neighbor, “I, I feel happy.”  Another word that was lost on him till now.  “You feel happy?  You feel happy?”  “It was just then, as you began to fall I…felt…a connection, to you.  I saw my present in your future, and knew that I did not want that for you.  I felt sad at the outcome, I felt for you, I felt.”  “Do you want to talk about it?”  “Yes, I think I do.”
