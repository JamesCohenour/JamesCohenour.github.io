        <p id = "Welcome2">
                The glistening water swayed the boat as Roff stared into its depths.  His skin glowed a golden yellow from the lake swirled and danced around him.  He liked it out here, not many others liked to brave the waters, but he was different.  As he rode across its surface, he knew a sense of something (was it calming?) that he couldn’t find back in the village.  The sun shone a beautiful orange as it ascended the eastern sky.  It was another perfect morning, though those weren’t in short supply here.  He rowed passed remnants of the place this once was, though its name and purpose was lost to time.<br>
                As he traveled, his oar suddenly caught on something and jolted him to his right side.  He fell into the water, his chest leading the way.  He didn’t descend far though, as he abruptly and quickly smashed into something hidden under the waves.  Gathering his bearings, he placed his hands on the object.  It was very hard with a unique shine and a point at the end, yet he knew not what it was for it was just another relic of a bygone era lost to the lake, he supposed.  He pushed off it and resurfaced after a moment for he had not sunken far.  As he climbed back in the boat, he knew of a problem inside his chest.  The fall must’ve done some damage he proposed, though it was no matter.  He would head back immediately and have it looked at.<br>
                A quarter day’s walk brought Roff back to the village, what he knew to call his home.  The dirt paths leading to and from the wooden houses that lined the passage were still slopped from a morning rain.  A quiet morning persisted on the street as the son commanded the sky, and brought a heat to dry the quaint assembly of life.<br>
            He traversed the paths until he found the doctor, his building most noticeable from the moss he let grow along the logs.  He entered through the doorway, and the doctor greeted him with a hello.  He sat down on the chair across from him and described what had happened at the lake.  “Could you lay on the table for me and I’ll assess the damage.”  After an extensive search of his chest, the doctor sat back down.  “I know the problem, but I’ve never seen anything like this before.”  Roff wondered what he meant, but asked for the details.  “Your heart, it’s damaged.  I found a crack along the surface and the integrity is no longer certain.”  Roff was confused, how could such a simple accident do such damage?  The doctor answered, “However miniscule the chances, the object you landed on must have hit you in just the right spot to bypass the protection of your chest.  I have known your next question and will answer it.  No, I can’t repair it.  The tools or knowledge to perform such a task simply do not exist.  I know sorrow for you.”<br> 
            Roff leaned back in his spot, not knowing what this meant.  “Do you know of death?”  Roff shook his head, the word was foreign to him, but it seemed to have ominous overtones.  “This crack could cause your heart to simply fall apart at any moment without warning, or it may hold together forever as it should.  I don’t have the answer, but you need to know of the possibility you may die.  That is, stop existing.”  Roff could not put this thought straight in his head.  Stop…existing?  How could something that is, cease to be?  The doctor didn’t have the answers he needed, but advised him to be careful.  With that Roff left the building, and began the trek home.<br>
                Roff arrived at this house about the time the sun had begun to lose its royal glow.  He entered his doorway sat in the chair in the corner of the space.  His head was still spinning from the day’s events, though he had never known such solidarity.  He had always had a problem communicating with those in his village, and now he was decidedly different.  As he sat there, he wondered what the others would now think of him, he knew he was no longer like them.<br>
                What is the point of thinking, of being?  He could stop existing at any moment, so why bother.  With that thought, Roff sat in that chair and made the choice to wait for death.  He waited, and waited, and continue to wait.  He sat in that chair for six days, waiting the moment to come when he would stop waiting.  Yet, his waiting continued.  Why must it wait he finally thought to himself.  Why can it not just happen now and be done, this knowing of not knowing is terrible.<br>
            On the seventh day, his neighbor entered his doorway.  “Greetings Roff, you have been sitting here for almost a week now!  Would you like to talk about something?”  Roff knew appreciation for this act, but knew not the words to say.  Roff told his neighbor he liked sitting, all was well and they could return to their activities.  With a raise of his brow, he turned and left the house.  Maybe that was a good idea Roff thought, and after a moment left his home.<br>
            He walked down the cracked dirt street out towards the forests, into the wild.  He did not know what he hoped to find here, but the sitting had not worked to find answers.  He decided to walk out to the lake again.  He thought along the way about his situation.  He still had no answer to what he should do now.  Does he continue to do his exploring as he always has, contributing to the village map?  What if his existence stopped on an expedition and he could never complete it?  He saw no point in continuing his task if there was no hope in finishing it.  He might as well just continue his sit, at least that would still be accomplished when he ceased.  Nevertheless, some part urged him forward, towards the lake.<br>  
            He arrived at the lake, his boat still resting on the shores where he had left it.  He placed himself on the edge of his boat and stared out over the water.  He was about to enter another contemplative state when a voice cut through the air.  “This place has beauty I have never seen.”  My neighbor, Roff knew.  No one had ever accompanied him on an adventure, and he knew not that his neighbor was on this one with him.  “So, this is what your activity is like I suppose, seeing that which has been unseen.  What is that?”  Roff didn’t understand the question at first, but then knew what his neighbor had referred to.  He explained how when he had discovered and studied his activity, he learned of ways other than walking to travel.  Many he did not understand, but the boat made sense to him.  He had crafted it with tools he had obtained in the village, and wood he gathered from the trees around the lake.  “Can we ride in it?  I am not scared of the water.”<br>  
            His neighbor walked over and sat inside the boat as Roff got up to push it in the water.  Roff grabbed his oar and jumped inside beginning his usual trek across the familiar waters.  His neighbor did as his neighbor does, talk and think.  Roff could not understand why his neighbor had chosen their activity to be such a thing, always talking to everyone.  Not only that, but constantly asking questions, and discussing what they knew.  It made no sense to Roff for he knew solidarity.  If he wanted information, he could just read about it.  Others may do as they please, but he has no gain from them.  “What is this place, what are these things, what are you thinking, how do you feel?”  That last question Roff also wondered, though not in the same way.  This was another word he did not know, and he was not sure where his neighbor had acquired it.<br>
            “Could you show me where you fell?”  Roff complied and maneuvered the boat over to the place.  “Oh, I see it!  What is it?”  Roff did not know, obviously, or he would have told them what it was.  “So because of this, pointy thing, you are going to…die?  Which is to stop existing, which I didn’t even know was a thing.  Do you want to talk, that has to be eating you up inside.”  No, he didn’t.  Obviously talking wasn’t going to fix the crack, and there was nothing left to understand, he was doomed.  He had no potential in this world, nothing left to do.<br>  
            “That has to feel horrible knowing that any moment could be your last.”  There’s that foreign word again.  He asked what it was then.  “Feel?  Well, it’s a feeling…er, its…hard to explain.  It’s like knowing, I suppose, but it’s less of a hard fact and more of a variable truth.  It just kind of happens.  Don’t worry, I haven’t met anyone that shared a knowledge of feeling.”  Roff wondered when it started, the ‘feeling’.  “It was not long after I pursued my activity.  I would ask the others questions, but then ask myself questions about their questions.  Before I knew it, there was this…connection to not only them, but myself. Something I had never experienced, and it opened up the world to me.”  Roff wondered if he would ever truly understand what they were even saying.<br>
            Roff’s neighbor turned and looked at the object again, leaning over the boat for a closer view.  It all happened in an instant.  Without warning, a wave rocked the boat and sent the neighbor overboard.  In his mind, Roff saw his neighbor plunged into the same situation he was in, a limbo state of unknown end.  He knew of the struggle he was going through, but his neighbor did not understand.  He understood the inevitability of his demise, but they had no such concept.  They would instantly be in his world, this state of unknowing fog.  How sad, Roff thought.  Sad.  Sad?  He had known this word, but never understood it.  He knew of the word, but suddenly he understood it.  He knew sadness at this moment, but it was more than that.  At this moment, frozen in time with his neighbor’s future in the air, he understood the word.  There was a connection with his neighbor.<br>
            He felt it.<br>
                As quickly as the wave came, Roff’s hand caught his neighbor’s shoulder.  His neighbor stared into the water, and as Roff slowly brought them back into the boat they turned and looked at him.  “I…I could have…thank you.”  Roff looked at his neighbor, “I, I feel happy.”  Another word that was lost on him till now.  “You feel happy?  You feel happy?”  “It was just then, as you began to fall I…felt…a connection, to you.  I saw my present in your future, and knew that I did not want that for you.  I felt sad at the outcome, I felt for you, I felt.”  “Do you want to talk about it?”  “Yes, I think I do.”<br>

    <h2 id = "Sapiens1">Sapiens</h2>
        <p id = "Sapiens2">
                Sapiens was so god damn interesting I’m probably going to buy this book and read it again.  The material was something I had never really learned, nor even considered learning, before.  It was definitely the perfect book to start with because it not only planted the seeds for thought and discussion, but set up a vocabulary that we could utilize to explain what we felt.  Sapiens really opened the door to the wonderment I have felt about human potential, and what it means to really live life.  By taking us through our own history, analyzing what it means, philosophically and literally, to be human, we can learn so much about ourselves and our societies.  Plus, the end, his look into our future, helped to shape what I thought of my own potential, especially considering my background in Computer Science.  This ending, with the discussion of the Gilgamesh Project and Artificial Intelligence was the basis for the story you read at the beginning.
                I think Harari’s exploration into the very pillars of human psyche, evolution, and society provided me with a framework to question my own journey.  Looking at the imagined orders of our lives and not only questioning and criticizing, but understanding them.  This I feel is essential to the human experience, and I’ll get back to this when I discuss Aristotle.  This discussion made me start to actually question my own decisions and ask myself why I do the things I do every day.  A big part of Harari’s message I feel is that we must look to the past and actually educate ourselves if we want to grow as not only a species, but as individuals.
                The thing I have drawn from most from Harari was his discussion on the Buddhist way, and the way we feel emotion.  I have been pretty good throughout my life at controlling how I show my anger but I’ve never been particularly good at processing and dealing with it.  Harari combined with the podcast and readings we did recently have really opened up my mind to “The Buddhist way.”  I’m not so much interested in the religious part the teachings themselves seem very helpful to me.  I’d love to learn more to help me on my path of controlling my emotions and how I deal with the stresses and intricacies of modern life.  Not only that but it really shed a light on my own journey and how that lack of ‘presentness’ I had with my own feelings just had me digging, for lack of a better term, my own grave.  You can witness this is the character of Roff, who I modeled after my own struggle with my emotions.  He doesn’t lack emotion, he just never knew how to feel them.  Until you open yourself up and have a genuine connection with someone else, whether it be romantic, a friendship, a close relative, whatever it may be that is very important if you want to understand your own emotions.

    <h2 id = "AriHun1">Aristotle/Hunger Games</h2>
        <p id = "AriHun2">
            This leads me to my next influencing work.  When I first read both the essay and the actual Aristotle reading, the language was lost on me.  I have a hard time understanding many of those older texts, and the essay used a lot of the same language.  After our discussion in class and a little bit of rereading, I finally understood.  This part is the part impacted me the most.  Aristotle teachings combined with the Hunger Games movie really made me think about the things I do on a daily basis.  Many of the things we do such as blindly watch TV, movies, listen to music, play games, they are completely without thought or virtue.  They are honestly complete wastes of time, unless you make it so they aren’t.  I used to do this, but now I analyze everything I consume with an electron microscope and ask WHY?  Why did the character in this movie do this?  What does that song lyric mean?  Why am I doing this in this game?  It has made me think more and more about the things I do and made me be more productive as a whole.  I have found myself creating more music, games, and stories than I have previous.  I am pursuing my passions with more validity than ever before, an unkindled fire now reignited within me.   
                Not only this, but I have put more stock in relationships.  I have made a lot of progress in opening up to people in the last 4 years since I started to come out of my shell at the end of Sophomore year.  I have been trying to let people in more and let people know the real me.  Because as we know from Aristotle, human relationships-friendship-is the key to a virtuous life.  Having people to share this experience with is vital to human potential because it makes us stop and evaluate our own actions.  When we share with others, we have to justify what we do and understand what we are doing and why we are doing it.  I’ve been trying to do that whenever I’m doing an activity is simply ask myself why I’m doing it, and what gain I am getting from said activity.  If I can’t answer that question, then I tell myself to stop doing it.  
                I wish I had this skill when I was in the trenches of my katabatic journey.  Playing video games can be one of if not the most thought-provoking activities I do because I have to actively make decisions and ask myself what the best plan of action is.  When playing online games, I am constantly working with my friends to plan out strategies or discuss the game.  However, video games can also be as mindless as social media if you don’t try to put some thought into it.  Sometimes I would fail to keep myself in line and just play games to play, pass the time, not be active.  I used them as a crutch for suppressing my feelings, instead using them as an activity to express my feelings.  
                I said it in my Hunger Games paper and I’ll say it again, that world is our future when we passively consume media the way that we do.  As depraved and different the society of the Hunger Games is from our own, they are also SO similar.  The obsession with TV, the stock they put in their “team”, the focus on beauty in the Capitol, the disparage of wealth, the list goes on and on.  It isn’t entirely crazy, given enough time, for something like that to occur in our society.  There’s a comedy call Idiocracy that came out in the early 2000’s and where Hunger Games is a true satire of society, Idiocracy is a true parody of the media age and the track society is on.  It’s scary how wild and yet true these both are.
                For the human species to advance, we need to stop being so damn selfish all the time.  If you want to reach your full potential, you have to let yourself connect with others and learn from them.  Everyone has a wildly unique experience of life, and everyone has invaluable information to share.  In the story, everyone has an “activity”, a task they choose to complete.  Roff’s activity was exploring the wilderness and mapping out the area around the village.  He had a goal and set out to complete it.  However, this is not virtuous living for he puts no stock in the activity itself.  He mindlessly maps it out as task, but is only interested in the finish.  I think the key to potential is not succeeding a task, but actively pursuing it.  Putting some thought and preparation into, thinking about the impact it will have and what others think or want.  Instead blindly mapping, he could be taking others out into the wild, showing them the beauty that he sees, sharing his experience.  He could be mapping out areas for a specific purpose, like planning a project for the village or people, or finding a way to a certain place.  Instead, he just maps.  This is opposed to the activity that his neighbor chooses, which is one of learning and interacting with others.  They are invested and interested in how the others think, behave, and feel.  That is a basis for a virtuous life is connecting with the thoughts and feelings of another, forming that bond and relationship.  They had an active, virtuous activity and we see how they try to help Roff through his rough time after his accident.  Like me, Roff pushed away others when they tried to help, but also never tried or even thought to reach out to others when we needed help.  All Roff needed to do was open up to his neighbor and form that bond.  Instead, he stews in his own unknowing and uncertainty.

    <h2 id = "Wild1">Into the Wild</h2>
        <p id = "Wild2">
            This ties in seamlessly with another great piece we read, Into the Wild.  Chris’ story is one of the most unique and thought-provoking stories there is, period.  That wonderous spirit within all of us comes alive when we are reading his story.   At first, I was a very judgmental of Chris, but as I got to know him and his story, I couldn’t help but see myself in him.  There are so many times, especially now that I want to just pack up and leave, explore the world.  There is a certain feeling you get when you’re out in the wild by yourself that you can’t find anywhere else.  There’s a peace, a connectivity with nature out there that is extremely special.  I think he was extremely brave to have a goal, what he saw as his full potential, and go for it.  That is extremely inspiring to me, and after reading this book I have just felt so enthused to just cut through all the bullshit and do what matters to me.  He was able to push himself to very literally abandon everything and pursue what mattered to him.  
                Now, it would seem to be a bit hypocritical to praise McCandless as a shining example of potential when he abandoned the very thing that makes life virtuous.  Human relationships are essential and vital to the human experience, and the very thing Chris was running from on his adventure.  He was always trying to get as far away from society as he possibly could.  When reading the book though, you can see that some of his happiest and most joyous times are with the people he meets along the way.  He just didn’t see it until it was too late.  While he is an inspiration, his very tale is a perfect example of the dependency we have on relationships for our own potential.   He realized it, at the end of his journey how important the human connection we share is, and how essential it is to our own survival.
                </p>
    <h2 id = "Breath1">When Breath Becomes Air</h2>
        <p id = "Breath2">
            Finally, we have When Breath Becomes Air.  This book is the ultimate venture into Death, told from someone experiencing it both second and firsthand.  It is very rare for me to feel so emotional from a book, but this book did it.  We all have a very personal association with death, it is one of the few things that ties everyone single person together, and also divides us.  His journey into the end of his life and the way he shares it so personally and without hesitation is one of the most unique reads I’ve ever had.  He also has a quote that without a doubt put into words and cemented the thoughts I had been having about human potential all semester.  In the very first paper we wrote I said that full potential was about the act of being on track to achieving your goals.  I think Kalanithi summed it up more perfectly than I could even imagine when he said, “You can’t reach perfection, but you can believe in an asymptote toward which you are ceaselessly striving.”  This single quote ties everything back together.  You cannot and will never be perfect, but that in itself is perfect.  We as humans need to strive for perfection, because within that drive we find the virtuous life that Aristotle described near the beginning of the semester.
                It is in Kalanithi’s experience that we find the power of the human spirit.  Even with death looming and his days numbered, he continues to strive and live the life that he wanted.  He didn’t let his impending mortality weigh him down, he built upon it.  We cannot (yet) stop death, and if we let it stop us from achieving our potential, then we will never continue our continuance as a species.  In the story, when Roff loses his immortality, he is completely lost.  He sees life as a pointless endeavor if we are all doomed to die anyways.  We can never reach the endless asymptote that is perfection as Kalanithi describes.  He struggles with this fact, sitting in his home and simply waiting for death to come.  You can’t live like that.  The most important fact that can be learned from Kalanithi’s story is that death is scary, death is inevitable, and death is the most important motivator you could ever have.  Anyone single one of us could drop dead right now, so as cliché as it sounds you have to live every day like it’s your last, because it could be.  Roff struggles with this newfound fact in the story and he is completely lost in the sudden limbo of existence he is thrust into.  That’s what we has humans have to contend with every day, but if we let it tie us down and simply sit and wait for death, we’ll have wasted all the potential we are given.  We don’t get a resolution to Roff’s struggle with his newfound mortality, but we as humans don’t either.  As of this writing, mortality is definite and there is no solving it.  
                At the end of the story, Roff has the realization and sudden connection with someone he never knew he could have.  This is also part of my story.  I had a lot of failed attempts at relationships throughout the years.  My senior year of high school, I had my very first girlfriend.  This is not about her.  For lack of better term, she was a manipulative bitch and she messed me up even more than I was.  Right there, at the moment when I needed someone the most, my friend Katelyn was there.  We had known each other since Kindergarten, that tends to happen in a school of 150 people, but suddenly it was like the veil was removed from my face, the fog lifted.  In that moment of true connection, I finally saw her for what she was, and that was perfect for me.  My Senior year of high school, I finally connected with the love of my life.  You know her, she sat next to me every day of class.  Genuine human connection is vital to a virtuous life, and the key to striving instead of surviving.  I know that now, and I can honestly say that I can appreciate that now more than ever because of this class.

    <h2 id = "Me1">My Story</h2>
        <p id = "Me2">
            When my parents split my world in two, I had no way to handle the feelings I knew.  Anger, sadness, lonely, longing, they all overwhelmed me.  I shut down myself, and shut out everyone else.  I didn’t know how to talk to people, I mean I was five years old I didn’t really know anything.  So, I delved into the one thing I did understand, and that was video games.  They let me feel what I couldn’t in actual life.  I felt brave, loved, understood in these worlds.  They were not only my escape, but my foray into life.  They taught me, raised me, I was myself when I was playing.  I couldn’t, at least I didn’t think I could, get these feelings anywhere else.  
            So, I continued to escape my hurt.  Unfortunately, the hurt never stops, and unless you deal with it, I learned, it will only grow.  I lost my family life at 5, my only grandpa at 7 (he was my best friend at the time), and my brother moved out at 15.  Sophomore year, 15 years old was the lowest moment of my life.  I had bottled up too much and those feelings all came up at once after all this had happened.  I didn’t see a point to life anymore and while I never attempted suicide, I wouldn’t have minded dying.  I saw no potential in myself, and the rest of my life would have been a waste.  
            This, is where I’ll begin.  I was very skeptical about this class at first.  I’m interested in writing, obviously, but I’m not an English major.  I was worried I would be out of place in this class.  I can honestly say that this was my favorite class I have had in college so far.  I generally hate all of my gen eds, but this class made me think in a way I have never been able to before.  That, is the heart of where I want to start.  
            I wrote the story at the beginning because I suck at painting but needed a way to creatively illustrate my journey.  I didn’t really have time to write some music, or I totally would’ve, so I did the story.  The story is a way for me to convey not only my journey, but what I see as the overarching message of this class.  I will reference it as I continue throughout paper.
            I want to take this conclusion to thank you Dr. Zona.  I have never, never had a class that was so personal and felt so right to take.  I have an appreciation for the class that you have created that I cannot put into words.  Most college Gen Eds are drivel bullshit that I’ll never even think about again, but I know that I couldn’t ever forget this class.  I wish there more classes like this, because they are honestly needed in school.  I have never cared so much for a class, and a class has never cared so much for me.  The things I learned in this class have impacted me in a such a way that I know that I am a much different person than I was just a couple months ago.  You actually made me question my major for a minute and wonder if maybe English is my true passion!  It only helped affirm my belief that what I am currently doing is the right path for me, but I have stopped accepting the fact that I have to just take a corporate job that I know I’m going to fucking abhor, and follow my true artistic passion of storytelling.  So, thank you, thank you more than I could ever describe, more than I could ever repay.  Maybe you’ll hear of me someday.
